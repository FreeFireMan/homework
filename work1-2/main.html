            Jason Statham (/ˈsteɪθəm/; born 26 July 1967) is an English actor and film producer. Typecast as the
            antihero,
            he is known for his action-thriller roles and portraying tough, irredeemable, and machiavellian characters.

        Born in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, he began practising kung fu, kickboxing and karate recreationally in his youth
        while
        working at local market stalls. An avid footballer and diver, he was selected by Britain's national diving team
        to
        compete in the 1990 Commonwealth Games. Shortly after, he was asked to model for French Connection, Tommy
        Hilfiger,
        and Levi's in various advertising campaigns. Statham's past professional history working in market stalls
        inspired
        his casting in the Guy Ritchie crime films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000).

        The commercial success of these films led him to star as Frank Martin in the Transporter trilogy (2002–08).
        After
        starring in a variety of heist and action thriller films such as The Italian Job (2003), Crank (2006), War
        (2007),
        The Bank Job (2008), The Mechanic (2011), Spy (2015) and Mechanic: Resurrection (2016), he established himself
        as a
        Hollywood leading man. However, he has also starred in such commercially and critically unsuccessful films as
        Revolver (2005), Chaos (2005), In the Name of the King (2007) by Uwe Boll, 13 (2010), Blitz (2011), Killer Elite
        (2011), Hummingbird (2013) and Wild Card (2015). He found further commercial success as a part of the ensemble
        action series The Expendables (2010–14) and the Fast & Furious franchise. In the latter, he has played his
        character, Deckard Shaw, in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Furious 7 (2015), The Fate of the Furious (2017) and in the
        spin-off Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019) which is also his debut and only work as a film
        co-producer.

        His acting career has been criticised for lacking depth and variety; however, he has also been praised for
        leading
        the 2000s and 2010s action film resurgences. According to a BBC News report, his film career from 2002 to 2017
        generated an estimated US$1.5 billion (£1.1 billion) in ticket-sales, making him one of the film industry's most
        bankable stars.

    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>
        Jason Statham was born on 26 July 1967 in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, to Eileen (née Yates), a dancer, and Barry
        Statham, a street seller. His father also worked odd jobs as a house painter, coal miner, and singer in the
        Canary Islands. He moved to Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, where he initially chose not to follow his father's career
        working the local market stalls, instead practising martial arts. He grew up with football player Vinnie Jones,
        alongside whom he would later act. Jones introduced him to football, and Statham went on to play for the local
        grammar school (1978–1983), which he had attended since age 11, a passion that he shared with diving. He
        practised daily in perfecting his diving techniques, and was a member of Britain's National Swimming Squad for
        twelve years. Statham competed for England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in the 10 meter, 3 meter, and 1
        meter competitions. He said in a 2003 interview with IGN that his time with the national squad was "a great
        experience" and one that "teaches you discipline, focus, and certainly keeps you out of trouble".

        Statham's life in the media began when he was spotted by the agency Sports Promotions specialising in sports
        modelling while he was training at London's Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. He was also signed by Tommy
        Hilfiger, Griffin, and Levis for various modelling contracts during their 1996 spring/summer collections. In
        1997, he became a model for the clothing brand French Connection. A spokesperson for the high street clothing
        chain
        said: "we chose Jason because we wanted our model to look like a normal guy. His look is just right for now:
        very
        masculine and not too male-modelly." However, he was still forced to follow in his father's footsteps as a
        street
        seller to make ends meet, selling "fake perfume and jewellery on street corners" according to Statham. He
        made small appearances in a few music videos, including "Comin' On" by The Shamen in 1993, "Run to the Sun" by
        Erasure in 1994, and "Dream a Little Dream of Me" by The Beautiful South in 1995.
